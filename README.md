# More-Mystcraft

***More Mystcraft*** is a collection of miscellaneous additions to the mod *Mystcraft*. It is hosted on CurseForge here: https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/more-mystcraft.

*More Mystcraft* currently has several foci:

**Structures**
* Adds an overworld structure called the Abandoned Study that is meant to provide some resources to players who have not yet traveled to any Ages. It can also spawn in Ages if the corresponding Page is used. There is a config option to disable the Book Binder recipe if you would like these Studies to be the only source of Descriptive Books.

**Pages**
* Pyramids: Features like Spheres and Spikes that accept blocks as modifiers.
* Size Pages: Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, and Huge.
* Rings Biome Distribution: A new biome distribution where the biome changes as you move outward from the center of the map.
* Normal Biome Distribution: Replaces the five "sized" biome distribution from Mystcraft and can be used with the Size pages.
* East-West and North-South Bands Distribution: Biomes bands expand into infinity.
* Boxes Biome Distribution: Just like Rings Biome DIstribution, but with right angles.
* Island Biome Distribution: Accepts one biome page and places it in the middle of an infinite ocean. Use in conjunction with a Standard World page for best results.
**Blocks**

* Traffic cone: Ensure explorers stay within DRC-approved areas!
