# More-Mystcraft

***More Mystcraft*** is a collection of miscellaneous additions to the mod *[Mystcraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mystcraft)*. It is hosted on CurseForge here: https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/more-mystcraft.

*More Mystcraft* currently only adds a structure that generates in the overworld: the abandoned study. It is meant to provide some resources to players who have not yet traveled to any Ages.
